# When Pigs Fly 🐉🐷

One of the first ever things I ever made! It's written in Processing(Java)

## Overview
When Pigs Fly is a side-scrolling game inspired by classics like Jetpack Joyride. Players assume the role of a newborn dragon equipped with the ability to shoot powerful energy blasts from its mouth. Control the dragon on its quest to defend its homeland against the onslaught of evil flying pigs.

## Controls
- Use the **mouse** to control the dragon
- Use the **left mouse button** to shoot fire bolts

## Playing The Game
You'll need to have [Processing](https://processing.org/) installed, but once that's done just clone the repo. Once you've cloned it open up WhenPigsFly.pde and click the run button :)
